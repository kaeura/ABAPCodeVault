Scope: 
- Printing of barcode label with the use of a Zebra printer (usually in client-site). 

Assumptions: 
- Printer size: 8.0 CM X 6.5 CM
- Printer Resolution: 3000 DPI (always ask the functional about printer resolution; but it is best to make your code dynamic by setting scales, for the program to work as expected in 1000 DPI, 2000 DPI, and 3000 DPI)

Constraints: 
 - Printer is on client site so the users will have to scan their printed barcode label and send to to the developer for any needed correction.
